# firefox-ss

Firefox 57+... Good lord... In my whole life no software update has messed
up my user experience this massively:
- my favorite extensions wouldn't work anymore
- hotkeys and keybinding wouldn't work anymore
- look-n-feel (UI) would be completely different: this ugly URL bar with
auto-focus set to true
- Shift-Ins and MiddleMouse would use different clipboard/selection buffers
- Extensions would be disabled on Privileged pages
- and so on...

This repo is my attempt to hack on FF and to make it closer to
pre-webextensions era, UI and user experience wise... and to make
it great again!

DONE:
- moved URL bar to tools bars
- A new Shift-slash hotkey to show/hide URL and extensions bar
- Removed auto-focus from URL bar styles
- Shift-ins insertion [mostly works for me]

TODO:
- Extensions and "privileged pages" fix up
